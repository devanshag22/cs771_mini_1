This repository contains all the experimentation code along with the final code for prediction on dataset.

Before Running the main file (82.py) make sure the datasets are placed in the folder.
Training dataset is also required as it freshly trains the model (it takes only a few seconds, and the seed values are fixed) and makes prediction and saves the prediction files.
